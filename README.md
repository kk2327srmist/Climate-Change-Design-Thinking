Dangerous air-pollution levels in Delhi illustrate why multifactorial pollution must not be ignored

• This year, Delhi has been ranked fifth out of the 32 megacities in the world in terms of population

• Regional meteorology results in a number of phenomena that influence Delhi’s air pollution. These include: high
winds and dusty conditions in summer emphasised by low relative humidity conditions, which enhance the
resuspension of particles; episodic dust transport events from nearby areas; background ozone concentrations
and long range transport of precursor emissions from subcontinental and intercontinental sources.

• As a result of Delhi’s geography, air – sometimes more polluted than in Delhi itself – moves into the city from
surrounding areas
